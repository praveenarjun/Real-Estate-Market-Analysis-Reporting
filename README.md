# Real Estate Big Data & Analytics Pipeline

## 1. Overview

This project implements a modern, end-to-end data pipeline on Microsoft Azure to ingest, process, and analyze a large-scale real estate dataset. The primary goal is to transform raw property data from various sources into actionable business intelligence, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions through advanced analytics and interactive visualizations.

The architecture is designed to be scalable, robust, and cloud-native, leveraging best-in-class Azure services for data engineering and analytics.

## 2. Key Features

- **Scalable Data Ingestion:** Utilizes Azure Data Factory to reliably ingest data from diverse sources like web APIs and SQL databases.
- **Modern Data Lake Architecture:** Employs Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) Gen2 for storing raw and transformed data, ensuring durability and cost-effectiveness.
- **Advanced Data Transformation:** Leverages the power of Azure Databricks for complex data cleaning, transformation, and enrichment using PySpark.
- **High-Performance Analytics:** Uses Azure Synapse Analytics as a unified analytics platform to serve processed data for high-speed querying.
- **Interactive Visualization:** Connects to BI tools like Power BI and Tableau to create insightful dashboards and reports for business users.

## 3. Architecture Overview

The pipeline follows a modern data engineering workflow, moving data from ingestion to visualization through distinct, well-defined stages.

The end-to-end flow is as follows:
1.  **Ingestion:** Data is pulled from sources using **Azure Data Factory**.
2.  **Storage (Bronze Layer):** Raw, untouched data is landed in **ADLS Gen2**.
3.  **Transformation:** **Azure Databricks** reads the raw data, cleans it, and enriches it with data from **MongoDB**.
4.  **Storage (Gold Layer):** The clean, transformed data is written back to **ADLS Gen2**.
5.  **Serving:** **Azure Synapse Analytics** provides a query engine over the clean data.
6.  **Visualization:** **Power BI** connects to Synapse to build reports.

## 5. Pipeline Stages in Detail

#### **Stage 1: Data Ingestion**

- An **Azure Data Factory (ADF)** pipeline is configured to connect to various data sources (e.g., a public GitHub repository via HTTP, an external SQL table).
- The ADF "Copy Data" activity extracts the data and transfers it into our Azure environment.

#### **Stage 2: Data Storage (Bronze Layer)**

- The raw data from ADF is landed in a dedicated container within **Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) Gen2**.
- This data is kept in its original, unaltered format. This "bronze" layer serves as a historical archive and allows for reprocessing if needed.

#### **Stage 3: Data Transformation and Enrichment**

- The arrival of new raw data in ADLS triggers a notebook in **Azure Databricks**.
- The Databricks notebook, written in **PySpark (Python)**, reads the raw data into a DataFrame.
- It performs extensive data cleaning, handles missing values, standardizes formats, and applies business logic.
- During this stage, it connects to an external **MongoDB** database to fetch additional data (e.g., demographic information, points of interest) to enrich the primary real estate dataset.

#### **Stage 4: Data Storage (Gold Layer)**

- After transformation, the clean, structured, and enriched data is written back to a separate "gold" container in **ADLS Gen2**.
- This data is typically stored in an optimized format like Parquet for efficient analytical querying.

#### **Stage 5: Data Serving and Visualization**

- **Azure Synapse Analytics** is used to create an external table that points to the "gold" data in ADLS. This allows for high-performance SQL querying directly on the processed data without needing to move it again.
- Business intelligence tools like **Power BI** connect to the Synapse Analytics endpoint to build interactive reports and dashboards, allowing business users to explore the data and uncover insights.

## 6. How to Set Up and Run

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    - An active Azure Subscription.
    - Azure CLI or PowerShell installed.

2.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/praveenarjun/Real-Estate-Big-Data-pipeline.git](https://github.com/praveenarjun/Real-Estate-Big-Data-pipeline.git)
    cd Real-Estate-Big-Data-pipeline
    ```

3.  **Deploy Azure Resources:**
    - Set up the required Azure services (ADF, ADLS, Databricks, Synapse, MongoDB) either manually through the Azure Portal or by deploying an ARM template (if provided).

4.  **Configure the Pipeline:**
    - Configure the connection strings and keys in Azure Data Factory to connect to your data sources and ADLS.
    - Set up the Databricks notebook and link it to the ADF pipeline.

5.  **Run the Pipeline:**
    - Trigger the main pipeline in Azure Data Factory to start the end-to-end data flow.

## 7. Future Improvements

- **Real-Time Streaming:** Integrate Azure Event Hubs or Apache Kafka to handle real-time data sources.
- **CI/CD Automation:** Implement CI/CD pipelines using Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions to automate the deployment of infrastructure and code.
- **Advanced Machine Learning:** Build and deploy machine learning models (e.g., for price prediction) using Azure Machine Learning service on the processed data.
